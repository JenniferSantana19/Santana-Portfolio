                <p class="card-text">The purpose of this project was to design an exercise app that implemented both duration and repetition exercises. I found that many exercise apps are too complicated with way too many features so I opted for a very clean and straightforward design. My biggest challenge with this project was figuring out how exactly to make this app as clean as possible, but I viewed the top exercise apps on the App Store and found out what I personally liked and disliked from many of them and from there began designing my ideal app. The colors I chose are purposefully muted and easy to look at to accentuate the cleanliness of the layout while also just making it pretty to look at. </p>

                <p class="card-text">With this project, I was tasked with improving an existing app’s layout. I decided to use the Netflix app. I wanted to simplify the layout as I believe that there are a lot of unnecessary and unimportant recommendations before you can view your “Continue Watching” and “My List” sections. So I opted to remove the large recommendation that pops up, and make sure “Continue Watching” and “My List” are the first things you see. I also cleared the top to make filtering by categories simpler. I also added the "Movies" and "TV Shows" filters on the bottom, replacing the “New & Hot” section because I believe the app is easier to navigate that way.

                <p class="card-text">For this project I was tasked with designing a Todo app. I struggled with this design as there are already many apps like this, so I did not know how to make mine stand out. I decided the best way to do this was to make it very user friendly and use lots of colors, so that the app would be cute and attract users. The app’s features include the option to label your tasks by color and subject, add deadlines, edit and remove tasks, and mark tasks as complete.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The purpose of this project was to create a functioning Sign Up and Login screen for a Todo app. With this project I struggled to get all of the functions to work, and it felt as though when one part was fixed, another stopped working. However, through much trial and error I was able to get the whole thing working, with the Sign Up process requiring a valid first name, last name, username (that is not taken), phone number, email, password (which had to be confirmed), and zip code. There was also an option to sign up for the app’s newsletter. Once the account was registered, it was redirected back to the login screen to login and from there to the app’s homepage.
